        VS Code Launch configurations for the LEAN engine

        Launch w/ Mono (Local):
        Builds the project with MSBuild and then launches the program using mono locally;
        supports debugging. In order to use this you need msbuild and mono on your system path.
        As well as the Mono Debug extension from the marketplace.
        
        Debug in Container:
        Launches our run_docker script to start the container and attaches to the debugger.
        Requires that you have built the project at least once as it will transfer the compiled
        csharp files.
        Requires Mono Debug extension from the marketplace.

        Attach to Python (Container):
        Will attempt to attach to LEAN in the container using PTVSD. Requires that the container is
        actively running and config is set: "debugging": true, "debugging-method": "PTVSD",
        Requires Python extension from the marketplace.

        Attach to Python (Local):
        Will attempt to attach to LEAN running locally using PTVSD. Requires that the process is
        actively running and config is set: "debugging": true, "debugging-method": "PTVSD",
        Requires Python extension from the marketplace.
